1. Passing command line arguments to a program when using gdb:
> Type the command at the bottom window on (gdb) prompt line

2. Set a breakpoint if and only if a set of conditions is true
>  break <source_file>:<breakpoint> if <conditional expression>
e.g. (gdb) break hello.c:6 if i >= ARRAYSIZE

3. Executing the next line of code (= instruction) after a breakpoint
> (gdb) next

4. If the next line of code is a function call, you'll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function instead?
> backtrace? 

5. How do you resume a program after stopping at a breakpoint?
> continue

6. How can you see the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
> (gdb) print <variable>

7. How do you configure gdb so it prints the value of a variable after every step?
> (gdb) watch <variable>

8. How do you print a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
> (gdb) info locals

9. How do you exit gdb
> (gdb) q
